# CAD_COURSE
THIS CODE IS A VERY EARLY VERSION--
I'm uploading it now to make sure I don't
lose anything and to show progression over
time. Right now, I've been getting openGL,
DearImgui, and simple object management to
work together. Lots of small things to make
the above work taken from an amalgmation of
resources online-- implementiations have been
adjusted for use in this application. Eventually,
things will be streamlined/overhauled even more.

For portions in which significant portions of 
"boiler-plate" code is nearly exactly the same
as a resource, detailed information about the
type of resource and how the resource was used
will (eventually) be provided.
